---COMPILATION---

For compile the source codes just do:

$ make

This will generate 3 executables:

1)index - our index
2)control - A program that uses libdivsufsort for comparison with our index.
3)textGenerator - A program responsible to generate well formed files

---INPUT FILES---

A well formed file is a text file that has the last symbol
lexicographically smaller than the others.

Ex:

actagaccat$


---EXECUTION---

Here we show how to run the programs

1)index
To create the index one must execute

$ ./index -create <inputFile> <indexFile>

To search for ocurrences, one must do:

$ ./index -search <indexFile> <inputFile> <patternFile>

2)control

Same semantic from 1)

3)textGenerator

To generate a DNA well formed text, one must to

$ textGenerator <textSize>  >  dnaText.txt
